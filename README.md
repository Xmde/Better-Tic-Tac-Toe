# Better-Tic-Tac-Toe Programmed By: Eric V
A better Tic Tac Toe game created in C++ for a School Project.

The program was made in Visual Studio 2019 and uses te CLR .NET framework buit in by Visual Studio.
The GUI is made using Visual Studio's Visual C++ Windows Fourm. Most of the main code is in the ttt.h and main.h files. 
All the ttt.cpp file does is render the fourm made in the ttt.h file.
